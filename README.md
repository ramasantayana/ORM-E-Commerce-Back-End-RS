# ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End-RS

For this project, I built the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.  Here is the link: https://youtu.be/2Q8GV0jJsgU

In creating this project and creating the walkthrough video, I received help and guidance from my tutor Suresh Kumar.
